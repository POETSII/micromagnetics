About
===

This repository contains various forays into event-based micromagnetic
simulation using POETS. It contains:

 - A generator to create application description files (XML), which can be run
   though POETS middleware (i.e. the Orchestrator).

 - Some postprocessing logic for results

The XML generated by the generator is written in Orchestrator-friendly V2, so
will be pretty meaningless to anyone not using the Orchestrator. V4
compatibility will follow when Mark has time.

Talk to Mark if you have any questions.

Compatibility and Language

Each tool has it's own section about this - you have been warned (they're very
MLV-centric for now, but can be extended for portability within reason).
