About
===

This repository contains various forays into event-based micromagnetic
simulation using POETS. It contains:

 - A generator to create application description files (XML), which can be run
   though POETS middleware (i.e. the Orchestrator).

 - Some postprocessing logic for results

The XML generated by the generator is written in Orchestrator-friendly V2, so
will be pretty meaningless to anyone not using the Orchestrator. V4
compatibility will follow when Mark has time.

Talk to Mark if you have any questions.
