It is to be populated with a series of files found in moustache brackets (two
sequent '{' characters, and two sequent '}' characters, without quotes). The
idea being that the generator populates fields in this XML file with
information. If this is a POETS-ready XML (i.e. it's gone through the
generator), this file should not contain any moustache brackets.

Regarding conventions: 0, 1, and 2 (ala x[0], x[1], and x[2]) are directions in
a right-handed co-ordinate system (such that e[0] cross e[1] = e[1], where e is
a unit basis vector in this system). This vector basis is used to describe both
the position of each cell in the domain (see the x[0] and x[1] (2d only) device
properties), and is also used to describe the magnetic moment field vector at
that point (see the m_x[0], m_x[1], and m_x[2] device states).

The term "x0plus" (or similar) is used in this description, which means, in the
context of the finite-difference discretisation: "the node one step ahead in
the 0 direction from this node". The step length is represented by `h` in the
mathematics (same for each direction), and is not explictly stated as a
property or state in this XML, but is incorporated into the interaction
coefficients.
